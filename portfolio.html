      <strong><p>About Me</p></strong>

      <p>
        I am currently a third-year digital art student. I chose to study in
        this field because I love creating and learning new ways to incorporate
        different topics. These courses have introduced me to new types of
        software and have changed the work that I create. I have a passion for
        design and learning. I'm very interested in understanding how we as
        humans think and interact with different media. I'd like to use the
        knowledge that I learn from understanding our thought process to create
        work that engages with users a lot better.
