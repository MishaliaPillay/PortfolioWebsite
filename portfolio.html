        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">GitHub:</h2>
        I am familiar with GitHub and already had it set up. I had a chance to
        use it last year for group assignments. It was overwhelming at first,
        but eventually, I understood its different features in saving and
        collaborating on work.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Readings:</h2>
        <p>
          <em> <strong>Bush</strong> ~As we may think-</em> In this reading,
          Bush discussed many possible advancements that could occur in the
          future. He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he knew
          what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to the fact
          that he was overwhelmed with the information presented to him. We are
          in the same predicament. We have lots of information coming our way
          from different sources and we are responsible for what we choose to
          interact with. I have always thought of the internet through the eyes
          of a user. Bush suggests that a mathematician is a skilled individual
          who has intuitive judgment. This is also coinciding with connotations
          of a creator. As a user, I am responsible for my interactions on the
          internet, but as a creator, I need to carefully consider what
          information I put out. Bush speaks about dry photography concerning
          books. He mentions people being able to add notes to books and their
          comments. He also discusses the possibility of being able to have
          multiple “projection positions” so that we may view different sources
          of information. This helps us create our understanding and helps us
          connect different sources by switching between them. This was exactly
          what I was doing when interacting with this reading. I had multiple
          tabs open and clicked through them to draw my connections. It was also
          helpful to be able to add annotations to the readings when I had to
          google a term or add my thoughts.

        <em> <strong> Borges</strong> ~The Library of Babel-</em> Borges
        discusses ideas of the internet through a story. It is very interesting
        to see how Borges and Bush discuss the same idea, but they explore it in
        different ways. Borges deals with the ways the internet could culturally
        connect people through breaking language barriers and sharing stories.
        Bush on the other hand speaks more to the idea of connecting people for
        research in order to further expand the study of various topics.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Goals for this course:</h2>
        My goal for this course is to be able to understand different coding
        languages and to use them to create websites and apps. I want to further
        understand what goes into making a successful website.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">My Experience starting HTML:</h2>
        Working with HTML has been very exciting. It&apos;s cool to quickly type
        out something and then see the result immediately. This is also great
        because I get to mess around with the layout and other aspects and get
        to see its results instantaneously. Which is really helpful in giving me
        a real-time understanding of HTML. I had never used HTML before and was
        very nervous, but the lectures presented the content in a very simple
        manner. Tags are quite nice because they are very clear about what they
        are used for. This also makes learning HTML that much easier.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflection on the readings:</h2>
        Sections are useful in creating a hierarchy through nesting. This is
        convenient in organizing text without having to follow the order of  <h1>, <h2>.
        This however does cause problems because it only changes how it looks
        visually, dev tools show that the text level may differ. This suggests
        that articles are a better way to contain headings and other data.
        Articles are also useful in sectioning data because the hierarchy for
        headers follows . Sections are better suited to contain the beginning
        and end of a portion of an article. We need to learn about the
        accessibility of our websites to reach a wider range of users. Screen
        readers are useful tools and impact how some users will interact with
        our websites. This is why it is advantageous for us to learn how HTML
        elements impact screen readers. Screen readers are unable to tell one
        item on a reading list from another. Screen readers also don&apos;t
        indicate where one bit of information ends. An example of why this is a
        problem is that someone may want to use a screen reader to access
        information in the abstract before they decide if the website has the
        information that they require. If the screen reader does not know where
        to stop the user becomes overwhelmed with information.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on internet histories:</h2>
        I found the timeline of the history of the web to be quite intriguing.
        It was so interesting to see how much progress was made. It was also
        great to see how creative the ideas were when the internet started. The
        internet has evolved to what it is now since they expanded on their
        ideas back then.
