          <em> <strong>Bush</strong> ~As we may think-</em> In this reading,
          Bush discussed many possible advancements that could occur in the
          future. He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he knew
          what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to the fact
          that he was overwhelmed with the information presented to him. We are
          in the same predicament. We have lots of information coming our way
          from different sources and we are responsible for what we choose to
          interact with. I have always thought of the internet through the eyes
          of a user. Bush suggests that a mathematician is a skilled individual
          who has intuitive judgment. This is also coinciding with connotations
          of a creator. As a user, I am responsible for my interactions on the
          internet, but as a creator, I need to carefully consider what
          information I put out. Bush speaks about dry photography concerning
          books. He mentions people being able to add notes to books and their
          comments. He also discusses the possibility of being able to have
          multiple “projection positions” so that we may view different sources
          of information. This helps us create our understanding and helps us
          connect different sources by switching between them. This was exactly
          what I was doing when interacting with this reading. I had multiple
          tabs open and clicked through them to draw my connections. It was also
          helpful to be able to add annotations to the readings when I had to
          google a term or add my thoughts.

        <em> <strong> Borges</strong> ~The Library of Babel-</em> Borges
        discusses ideas of the internet through a story. It is very interesting
        to see how Borges and Bush discuss the same idea, but they explore it in
        different ways. Borges deals with the ways the internet could culturally
        connect people through breaking language barriers and sharing stories.
        Bush on the other hand speaks more to the idea of connecting people for
        research in order to further expand the study of various topics.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Goals for this course:</h2>
        My goal for this course is to be able to understand different coding
        languages and to use them to create websites and apps. I want to further
        understand what goes into making a successful website.
