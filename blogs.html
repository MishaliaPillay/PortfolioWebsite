        I am familiar with GitHub and already had it set up. I had a chance to
        use it last year for group assignments. It was overwhelming at first,
        but eventually, I understood its different features in saving and
        collaborating on work.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Readings:</h2>
        <p>
          <em> <strong>Bush</strong> ~As we may think-</em> In this reading,
          Bush discussed many possible advancements that could occur in the
          future. He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he knew
          what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to the fact
          that he was overwhelmed with the information presented to him (Bush,
          1979). We are in the same predicament. We have lots of information
          coming our way from different sources and we are responsible for what
          we choose to interact with. I have always thought of the internet
          through the eyes of a user. Bush suggests that a mathematician is a
          skilled individual who has intuitive judgment(Bush, 1979). This is
          also coinciding with connotations of a creator. As a user, I am
          responsible for my interactions on the internet, but as a creator, I
          need to carefully consider what information I put out. Bush speaks
          about dry photography concerning books. He mentions people being able
          to add notes to books and their comments. He also discusses the
          possibility of being able to have multiple “projection positions” so
          that we may view different sources of information(Bush, 1979). This
          helps us create our understanding and helps us connect different
          sources by switching between them. This was exactly what I was doing
          when interacting with this reading. I had multiple tabs open and
          clicked through them to draw my connections. It was also helpful to be
          able to add annotations to the readings when I had to google a term or
          add my thoughts.
        </p>

        <em> <strong> Borges</strong> ~The Library of Babel-</em> Borges
        discusses ideas of the internet through a story. It is very interesting
        to see how Borges and Bush discuss the same idea, but they explore it in
        different ways. Borges deals with the ways the internet could culturally
        connect people through breaking language barriers and sharing
        stories(Borges 1998). Bush on the other hand speaks more to the idea of
        connecting people for research in order to further expand the study of
        various topics.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Goals for this course:</h2>
        My goal for this course is to be able to understand different coding
        languages and to use them to create websites and apps. I want to further
        understand what goes into making a successful website.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">My Experience starting HTML:</h2>
        Working with HTML has been very exciting. It&apos;s cool to quickly type
        out something and then see the result immediately. This is also great
        because I get to mess around with the layout and other aspects and get
        to see its results instantaneously. Which is really helpful in giving me
        a real-time understanding of HTML. I had never used HTML before and was
        very nervous, but the lectures presented the content in a very simple
        manner. Tags are quite nice because they are very clear about what they
        are used for. This also makes learning HTML that much easier.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflection on the readings:</h2>
        Sections are useful in creating a hierarchy through nesting. This is
        convenient in organizing text without having to follow the order of
        &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;h2&gt; . This however does cause problems because it
        only changes how it looks visually, dev tools show that the text level
        may differ. This suggests that articles are a better way to contain
        headings and other data. Articles are also useful in sectioning data
        because the hierarchy for headers follows &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;h2&gt;.
        Sections are better suited to contain the beginning and end of a portion
        of an article. We need to learn about the accessibility of our websites
        to reach a wider range of users. Screen readers are useful tools and
        impact how some users will interact with our websites. This is why it is
        advantageous for us to learn how HTML elements impact screen readers.
        Screen readers are unable to tell one item on a reading list from
        another. Screen readers also don&apos;t indicate where one bit of
        information ends. An example of why this is a problem is that someone
        may want to use a screen reader to access information in the abstract
        before they decide if the website has the information that they require.
        If the screen reader does not know where to stop the user becomes
        overwhelmed with information.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on internet histories:</h2>
        I found the timeline of the history of the web to be quite intriguing.
        It was so interesting to see how much progress was made. It was also
        great to see how creative the ideas were when the internet started. The
        internet has evolved to what it is now since they expanded on their
        ideas back then.

          My Experience in Developing my Website:
        </h2>
        It is very exciting to learn CSS and to see how it works with HTML to
        produce a website. The lectures are proficiently constructed, and this
        helps me engage with the content without getting lost. I also really
        like that we are shown the different methods of getting things done as
        well as being taught the preferred method to use. This helps me
        understand the functions of the code that I use, rather than just
        copying it down with no understanding.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflection on reading and lecture:</h2>

        The reading on convention and context is in accordance with the
        technical lecture on CSS. Before we start making huge design decisions,
        we need to get a sense of which UI and UX are successful and have thus
        become a convention. Conventions in terms of the Mailloux reading are
        practices that are created through a collaborative effort (Mailloux
        2015: 399). This means that ideas that fall into certain conventions are
        agreed upon and act as a basis. Mailloux discusses three types of
        conventions. These are traditional conventions, prescriptive
        conventions, and constitutive conventions. Traditional conventions are
        common methods that have been used in the past (Mailloux 2015: 399).
        Conventions can change and quickly become the norm if it is adopted by
        others. This change in conventions makes room for innovative ideas
        (Mailloux 2015: 399). Conventions regarding UI and UX are vital for us
        to move forward as creators. By understanding the conventions of UI and
        UX we will be able to tackle the issues that arise because conventions
        have “regularities and expectations “(Mailloux 2015: 400). This means
        problems become solvable. There must be a reason why a practice becomes
        a convention. This is why we should learn from them. We need to break
        down traditional conventions and understand how and why they work
        (Mailloux 2015: 401). By understanding past methods, we can draw up new
        ideas for prescriptive conventions. Mailloux also discusses the idea
        that conventions are trans-situational (Mailloux 2015: 403). This is
        important to note that conventions are useful learning tools but are to
        be taken with a grain of salt. He suggests that sometimes conventions
        are not fully planned out ideas but rather solutions to fit the problem.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Thoughts on Supplementary material:</h2>

        The supplementary material is quite helpful. It builds on and reiterates
        the content covered in class. In these lectures, they also share other
        resources and different opinions. By watching the past lectures, I feel
        as though I am reviewing my work for the week. I am also gaining a
        better understanding of the content since its being presented from
        different points of view.

          My Experience in Developing my Website:
        </h2>
        I&apos;ve realised how important it is to have wireframes. Otherwise,
        I&apos;d have to build my website blindly and that becomes messy. I have
        also been looking at new methods of creating my wireframes. I started
        off drawing it on paper and I added in my ideas all over. I then remade
        it digitally. I used this as an opportunity to refine my ideas and clean
        up the layout. I have also been practising CSS through exercises I found
        online. This has helped me find more features to incorporate on my
        website.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Wireframes:</h2>

        The readings and the lectures have helped me identify gaps in my
        wireframes. Since I have found many methods of displaying information on
        my website, it doesn&apos;t mean that I should use all of them. The
        readings have helped me recognise that this would overwhelm and confuse
        the user. One of the gaps that this week&apos;s lecture has helped me
        identify is that I need systems that will allow the user to navigate
        between each blog. I had never thought about how tedious it would be to
        click through each of the blogs to reach a particular week. Another
        thing to consider was what options would the user have after they have
        read a post. I then needed to create another iteration of my wireframe
        that included more navigation options such as moving to the next,
        previous page as well as an option to go back to the homepage.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">How UI relates to interactivity:</h2>

        When we look at UI and interactivity, we can answer important questions
        such as: how does the design of my website affect how it is used? It
        also helps us evaluate the feedback given to a user in terms of its
        non-random response.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on readings:</h2>

        What makes a website successful is good UI. This can be accomplished by
        following the basic principle outlined by Uxpin. When designing
        websites, we must keep in mind who our target audience is and what they
        need (Uxpin 2020:1). Once we identify this, we can then use conventions
        suited to the user's needs. An example of why this is useful is that we
        are making a portfolio website. Which means that we cannot use the
        conventions of an online store. We also need to clearly show how the
        user can interact with the website (Uxpin 2020:2). This is vital so that
        we avoid a “what now?” situation where the user is unsure how to proceed
        and then click off our website. Consistency is what creates a seamless
        interaction with a website (Uxpin 2020:3). This was important for me to
        take note of since I got too excited when creating wireframes and added
        too many methods of displaying information to the user. I now realise
        that this would be confusing to the user.

          My Experience continuing the development of my website:
        </h2>
        This week I focused on annotating my wireframes and playing around with
        different layouts. I have also been working through these wireframes
        practically by implementing them on my website. I am looking into the
        CSS code that might go into my website. Some sections of my wireframes
        have been annotated with the code that I think could be used to
        accomplish those goals.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Introduction to the DOM:</h2>
        The technical lectures this week showed me more ways to utilise
        attributes in HTML. It also allowed me to understand the importance and
        flow of hierarchy in a web browser. It was cool to be able to click a
        button and have it affect the content and colour of the HTML page. I
        really struggled with these exercises. I tried many methods to complete
        the exercises, but I could not get them to work. This did not discourage
        me, and I am currently working on ways to get my code working. I found
        it useful to comment out the sections of code that did not work. This
        method allows me to go back and look at my flow of thinking as well as
        pinpoint where I went wrong. This will get me in the habit of thinking
        critically to solve future problems that I may come across.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Side Quests:</h2>

        This week I found myself stressing over the coding aspect of this
        course. I decided to go through the MDN Docs and learn the basics of
        HTML and CSS. The lectures have done a good job of introducing these
        coding languages to me. However, I felt that I needed to do further
        research to understand the syntax. I have also created a “Test Site”.
        This is where I worked through new techniques that I learnt from MDN
        Docs and W3Schools. This works as a form of documentation/ a cheat sheet
        that I can always refer to.

        </h2>
        This week I evaluated every element of my website critically using the
        notes from the IXD lecture. I have changed my layouts to fit the visual
        information structure as well as the hierarchy of information presented
        to the user. I wasn't aware that the shape of buttons is associated with
        specific meanings. I decided to use rounded button shapes Since my
        website is a Portfolio and I want it to come across as friendly to
        attract more users.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">IxD UI UX Process:</h2>
        The lecture notes this week have been helpful and provided a lot of
        information that I need to consider for my website. This supplies me
        with a framework on which to base my design choices. These notes also
        put a lot of the previous theory work into much easier-to-absorb
        diagrams. These diagrams have visualised some aspects that I had
        previously not understood.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Side Quests:</h2>
        I continued my research and practice of coding. I found some cool
        websites that teach CSS in creative ways. I have learnt how grid
        elements work and that there are many short hands that I can use in the
        future. The shorts hands are transferrable to other elements in CSS such
        as margins and padding. These websites had many exercises for me to
        practice on. I noticed that as I progressed, I could work through them a
        lot quicker. This helped me gain muscle memory and quick recall which
        has helped me develop my website.

          Experience continuing development of my website:
        </h2>

        This week has been lots of chopping and changing my wireframes. These
        changes weren&apos;t too big since they only involved small navigation
        options that I needed to add. I needed to do this because I had to take
        UX and UI into consideration. Some layouts looked better in theory but
        not in a practical sense. I also had to evaluate my design and criticise
        whether it fits in with my goals and the goals of the user. “a good
        product performs without being recognised”. This quote from the reading
        also helped me make some changes in my design.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">IxD Process Mashup Lecture:</h2>

        I have focused on goal alignment and information structure. I laid out
        information based on cohesion, in terms of the weekly blogs, and how my
        layout utilised negative space. I am still working on some interface
        options such as the navigation options. This is also where I looked at
        my goals and the users&apos; goals. I noticed my interaction with other
        websites this week. I, as many other users will agree, needed to find
        the information very quickly. So, I explored different options on how to
        implement this.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on Reading:</h2>

        The reading by Marc Hassenzahl & Noam Tractinsky focused on User
        experience. The term User experience (UX) has different
        connotation&apos;s that we can associate with names, the affective
        response and the usable functionality of technology. This reading
        outlined the importance of the emotional experience of the user and how
        this influences their decision-making (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006:
        93). First responses stick and the designer needs to be able to grab the
        user&apos;s attention very quickly. As humans, we tend to remember
        negative interactions as opposed to positive ones. Thus, we must design
        a positive experience for the user. Designers can&apos;t directly
        conjure up a positive emotional response from a user since other aspects
        are involved. These other aspects are the environment in which the
        interaction takes place and the internal state of the user (Hassenzahl &
        Tractinksy 2006: 95). The designed system affects UX, however, the other
        aspects need to be taken into consideration when designing. As
        designers, we are not able to control the user (well not entirely), but
        we can create our systems with a positive context in mind (Hassenzahl &
        Tractinksy 2006: 94). This is where the Experiential approach comes in.
        This approach suggests that the product and the internal state of the
        user need to complement each other, and this will result in UX. It is
        important to consider what goes into creating products for the user. We
        need to carefully consider what we include in our design because every
        little detail adds to an experience. This reading made me realise that
        there needs to be reasoning behind what we create because this
        ultimately will affect how a product is interacted with.

          This Research Paper looked into how visual design choices affect
          usability. This looks at the formal and sensory attributes of a
          product. The sensory attributes are the colour choices and the formal
          attributes are the shapes of elements on a site.

          This was my holy grail when I started coding. I needed to have a quick
          reference to these selectors and how to use them.
