        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">GitHub:</h2>
        I am familiar with GitHub and already had it set up. I had a chance to
        use it last year for group assignments. It was overwhelming at first,
        but eventually, I understood its different features in saving and
        collaborating on work.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Readings:</h2>
        <p>
          <em> <strong>Bush</strong> ~As we may think-</em> In this reading,
          Bush discussed many possible advancements that could occur in the
          future. He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he knew
          what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to the fact
          that he was overwhelmed with the information presented to him. We are
          in the same predicament. We have lots of information coming our way
          from different sources and we are responsible for what we choose to
          interact with. I have always thought of the internet through the eyes
          of a user. Bush suggests that a mathematician is a skilled individual
          who has intuitive judgment. This is also coinciding with connotations
          of a creator. As a user, I am responsible for my interactions on the
          internet, but as a creator, I need to carefully consider what
          information I put out. Bush speaks about dry photography concerning
          books. He mentions people being able to add notes to books and their
          comments. He also discusses the possibility of being able to have
          multiple “projection positions” so that we may view different sources
          of information. This helps us create our understanding and helps us
          connect different sources by switching between them. This was exactly
          what I was doing when interacting with this reading. I had multiple
          tabs open and clicked through them to draw my connections. It was also
          helpful to be able to add annotations to the readings when I had to
          google a term or add my thoughts.
        </p>

        <em> <strong> Borges</strong> ~The Library of Babel-</em> Borges
        discusses ideas of the internet through a story. It is very interesting
        to see how Borges and Bush discuss the same idea, but they explore it in
        different ways. Borges deals with the ways the internet could culturally
        connect people through breaking language barriers and sharing stories.
        Bush on the other hand speaks more to the idea of connecting people for
        research in order to further expand the study of various topics.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Goals for this course:</h2>
        My goal for this course is to be able to understand different coding
        languages and to use them to create websites and apps. I want to further
        understand what goes into making a successful website.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">My Experience starting HTML:</h2>
        Working with HTML has been very exciting. It&apos;s cool to quickly type
        out something and then see the result immediately. This is also great
        because I get to mess around with the layout and other aspects and get
        to see its results instantaneously. Which is really helpful in giving me
        a real-time understanding of HTML. I had never used HTML before and was
        very nervous, but the lectures presented the content in a very simple
        manner. Tags are quite nice because they are very clear about what they
        are used for. This also makes learning HTML that much easier.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflection on the readings:</h2>
        Sections are useful in creating a hierarchy through nesting. This is
        convenient in organizing text without having to follow the order of
        &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;h2&gt; . This however does cause problems because it
        only changes how it looks visually, dev tools show that the text level
        may differ. This suggests that articles are a better way to contain
        headings and other data. Articles are also useful in sectioning data
        because the hierarchy for headers follows &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;h2&gt;.
        Sections are better suited to contain the beginning and end of a portion
        of an article. We need to learn about the accessibility of our websites
        to reach a wider range of users. Screen readers are useful tools and
        impact how some users will interact with our websites. This is why it is
        advantageous for us to learn how HTML elements impact screen readers.
        Screen readers are unable to tell one item on a reading list from
        another. Screen readers also don&apos;t indicate where one bit of
        information ends. An example of why this is a problem is that someone
        may want to use a screen reader to access information in the abstract
        before they decide if the website has the information that they require.
        If the screen reader does not know where to stop the user becomes
        overwhelmed with information.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on internet histories:</h2>
        I found the timeline of the history of the web to be quite intriguing.
        It was so interesting to see how much progress was made. It was also
        great to see how creative the ideas were when the internet started. The
        internet has evolved to what it is now since they expanded on their
        ideas back then.

          My Experience in Developing my Website:
        </h2>
        It is very exciting to learn CSS and to see how it works with HTML to
        produce a website. The lectures are proficiently constructed, and this
        helps me engage with the content without getting lost. I also really
        like that we are shown the different methods of getting things done as
        well as being taught the preferred method to use. This helps me
        understand the functions of the code that I use, rather than just
        copying it down with no understanding.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflection on reading and lecture:</h2>

        The reading on convention and context is in accordance with the
        technical lecture on CSS. Before we start making huge design decisions,
        we need to get a sense of which UI and UX are successful and have thus
        become a convention. Conventions in terms of the Mailloux reading are
        practices that are created through a collaborative effort (Mailloux
        2015: 399). This means that ideas that fall into certain conventions are
        agreed upon and act as a basis. Mailloux discusses three types of
        conventions. These are traditional conventions, prescriptive
        conventions, and constitutive conventions. Traditional conventions are
        common methods that have been used in the past (Mailloux 2015: 399).
        Conventions can change and quickly become the norm if it is adopted by
        others. This change in conventions makes room for innovative ideas
        (Mailloux 2015: 399). Conventions regarding UI and UX are vital for us
        to move forward as creators. By understanding the conventions of UI and
        UX we will be able to tackle the issues that arise because conventions
        have “regularities and expectations “(Mailloux 2015: 400). This means
        problems become solvable. There must be a reason why a practice becomes
        a convention. This is why we should learn from them. We need to break
        down traditional conventions and understand how and why they work
        (Mailloux 2015: 401). By understanding past methods, we can draw up new
        ideas for prescriptive conventions. Mailloux also discusses the idea
        that conventions are trans-situational (Mailloux 2015: 403). This is
        important to note that conventions are useful learning tools but are to
        be taken with a grain of salt. He suggests that sometimes conventions
        are not fully planned out ideas but rather solutions to fit the problem.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Thoughts on Supplementary material:</h2>

        The supplementary material is quite helpful. It builds on and reiterates
        the content covered in class. In these lectures, they also share other
        resources and different opinions. By watching the past lectures, I feel
        as though I am reviewing my work for the week. I am also gaining a
        better understanding of the content since its being presented from
        different points of view.

          Experience continuing development of my website:
        </h2>

        This week has been lots of chopping and changing my wireframes. These
        changes weren&apos;t too big since they only involved small navigation
        options that I needed to add. I needed to do this because I had to take
        UX and UI into consideration. Some layouts looked better in theory but
        not in a practical sense. I also had to evaluate my design and criticise
        whether it fits in with my goals and the goals of the user. “a good
        product performs without being recognised”. This quote from the reading
        also helped me make some changes in my design.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">IxD Process Mashup Lecture:</h2>

        I have focused on goal alignment and information structure. I laid out
        information based on cohesion, in terms of the weekly blogs, and how my
        layout utilised negative space. I am still working on some interface
        options such as the navigation options. This is also where I looked at
        my goals and the users&apos; goals. I noticed my interaction with other
        websites this week. I, as many other users will agree, needed to find
        the information very quickly. So, I explored different options on how to
        implement this.
        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Reflections on Reading:</h2>

        The reading by Marc Hassenzahl & Noam Tractinsky focused on User
        experience. The term User experience (UX) has different
        connotation&apos;s that we can associate with names, the affective
        response and the usable functionality of technology. This reading
        outlined the importance of the emotional experience of the user and how
        this influences their decision-making (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006:
        93). First responses stick and the designer needs to be able to grab the
        user&apos;s attention very quickly. As humans, we tend to remember
        negative interactions as opposed to positive ones. Thus, we must design
        a positive experience for the user. Designers can&apos;t directly
        conjure up a positive emotional response from a user since other aspects
        are involved. These other aspects are the environment in which the
        interaction takes place and the internal state of the user (Hassenzahl &
        Tractinksy 2006: 95). The designed system affects UX, however, the other
        aspects need to be taken into consideration when designing. As
        designers, we are not able to control the user (well not entirely), but
        we can create our systems with a positive context in mind (Hassenzahl &
        Tractinksy 2006: 94). This is where the Experiential approach comes in.
        This approach suggests that the product and the internal state of the
        user need to complement each other, and this will result in UX. It is
        important to consider what goes into creating products for the user. We
        need to carefully consider what we include in our design because every
        little detail adds to an experience. This reading made me realise that
        there needs to be reasoning behind what we create because this
        ultimately will affect how a product is interacted with.
