          This was very first wireframe. It was done in week 2 , before the
          assignment brief was released.
        </p>
        My next set of wireframes are broken up into sections. The initial idea
        was to have one long page with everything on it . I then realised how
        tedious this might be to interact with. Thus I decided against it .
        (These wireframes were completed after the assginment brief was
        uploaded.)
        <p class="designblocks">
          These annotations decpict the code language or section of code that
          these elements will be a part of . Red is the response based on the
          users input . Blue shows all the naigation elements.

            alt="orginal blogs wireframe"
            id="designimg"
          />Red is the response based on the users input . Red is possibly
          JavaScript so these elements may only be implemented for assignment 2
          .
        </p>

        <p class="designblocks">
          Green shows the visual responses. The Green elements will be
          implemented by CSS.

          I am able to easily transfer information to smaller devices. This is
          because the information on my site is presented in blocks. These
