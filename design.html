          This was my very first wireframe. It was done in week 2 , before the
          assignment brief was released.
        </p>
        My next set of wireframes are broken up into sections. The initial idea
        was to have one long page with everything on it . I then realised how
        tedious this might be to interact with. Thus I decided against it .
        (These wireframes were completed after the assginment brief was
        uploaded.)

          The input controls are only buttons. This is because my website only
          displays information and no other user input is required. Users may
          use these buttons to navigate to a section in the site . Users may
          also open and close paragraphs.

        <p class="designblocks">
          I want my website to look professional with a pink aesthetic and a
          tidy layout of blocks that organise information in an easy-to-digest
          manner.

        <h2 class="evensmallertitles">Visual and Design Elements Selected</h2>
        <strong> Fonts: </strong>
        <p class="designblocks">
          I wanted to incorporate Monospaced font into my website. This is
          because it is associated with coding and it was on a list of
          professional fonts. This would help me achieve my design goal of
          professionalism. This font has good legibility, however, it does not
          have good readability. Which meant I could not use this text for my
          paragraphs. This is where my second font choice, Sans-Serif, came in.
          I decided to use Sans-Serif for the content of my website and
          Monospaced for the navigation headings
        </p>

            alt="color palatte"
            id="designimg"
          />
          I chose a monochromatic colour palette for my website. According to
          colour theory, this created a harmonious look for a website. Since
          this is a portfolio website I chose the colour pink which I feel
          represents me. The pale pink of the background is a relaxing colour
          according to colour psychology. The darker shades of pink are used to
          show interactability since they capture a user's attention due to the
          saturation contrast.
        </p>
        <strong>Composition</strong>
        <p class="designblocks">
          There is a hierarchy created through font sizes. Balance is created
          through paragraph boxes which create a neat layout.
        </p>
        <strong>Interface Elements</strong>
        <p class="designblocks">
          Headings are centre-aligned and any other text is left-aligned. This
          creates a contrast and helps the user distinguish between the two.
          Most of the content on a page is hidden and is only accessed when a
          user clicks a button. This cleans up the layout so the user is not
          overwhelmed with information. The pink paragraphs, that nest in a grey
          paragraph box, alternate the text and image orientation. This creates
          a visually interesting site since the user does not get bored with the
          same layout. I also have different styling as well as font sizes of
          text on my website. The larger headings have a text shadow. Smaller
          headings such as "Reflections on this week's reading: " are bold and
          underlined. These conventions are used throughout my website and give
          the user context on how to proceed when switching through the HTML
          pages.

          I am able to easily transfer information to smaller devices. This is
          because the information on my site is presented in blocks. These

        <strong>Semantic Markup:</strong>
        <p class="designblocks">
          I used the heading tags for hierarchy and not to affect the sizing of
          the text. I placed my paragraphs into articles. I made use of sections
          and articles but stayed clear of divs. I used sections and articles to
          create a hierarchy of information. I needed to do this so I could
          compact information into smaller bits. While still allowing the users
          to access this information easily.
        </p>
        <strong> CSS:</strong>
        <p class="designblocks">
          I used classes and IDs which helped me avoid in-line styles. I have
          implemented responsive layouts which can be seen by the burger button
          that replaces the header text. I also used targets which helped me
          open and close paragraphs. I also added code that closes one paragraph
          when one is opened. The button interface, navigation, at the top of a
          page closes all of the paragraphs and opens the one the user clicked
          on.
