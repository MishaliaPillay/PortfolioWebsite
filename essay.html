        Case study: Candle Merchant https://www.thecandlemerchant.co.za/
      </h2>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Websites are structured using user interface (UI) and user experience
        (UX). Designers take careful considerations when creating each aspect of
        a website. They also look at how their decisions impact the decisions
        made by a user. I intend to evaluate the ethics of the Candle Merchant.
        This will be done by analysing how the design principles are implemented
        in this website.
      </p>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        User interface design determines the usability of a “software product”
        (Thimbleby 1990: 1). Usability is determined by the effectiveness of a
        product (Thimbleby 1990: 2). There are certain standards and conventions
        that exist for these software products. Conventions have a predetermined
        effectiveness aspect to them, and creators are encouraged to utilise
        them. Certain practices are repeated, thus they become conventions.
        Creators with similar intentions collaborate and adopt these practices
        (Mailloux 2015: 399). Users become accustomed to these conventions, and
        it forms the basis of their understanding for interacting with these
        products (Mailloux 2015: 400). The content of a product is what leads a
        user to a particular website. An example is the user searching “candle
        supplier” on Google and the search engine shows multiple results for the
        user to click on. The way the content is presented to a user on a
        website is what determines if the user will continue exploring the site
        or “take their business elsewhere” (Cappel & Huang 2007: 117). Thus,
        products are created with the basic principles of user interface design
        in mind.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        An important design principle is consistent design (Uxpin 2020: 2). The
        Candle Merchant website shows consistency through the similar squared
        buttons and squared images used throughout the site. Content is also
        present in square blocks on this site. The Candle Merchant however lacks
        consistency in the feedback given to a user, when they hover their mouse
        over a purchasable item. The design is inconsistent as the image of the
        item changes sometimes. Another issue is that the image that it changes
        to is often misleading since the image changes to something completely
        different. An example of this is when the user hovers over the “Votive
        Glass Clear” item and the image change to a candle holder. This ties
        into the cognitive load design principle (Uxpin 2020: 4). The changed
        image affects the user's recall. This directly influences the
        users&apos; decision in purchasing the item since it becomes slightly
        unclear as to which item they&apos;re about to purchase. The image
        changing incorrectly is also an example of poor design because the UI is
        no longer invisible (Uxpin 2020: 3). The Candle Merchant thus requires
        the user&apos;s active attention. If the UI design was invisible, it
        would&apos;ve provided a seamless mediation between the user and the
        site resulting in a successful sale for the Candle Merchant.
      </p>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Accessibility is a principle of user interface design (Uxpin 2020: 2).
        Many users have disabilities that affect their usage of websites. This
        is why designers need to make their websites accessible. One of the ways
        this can be done is with the screen reader. Users that are visually
        impaired use the information provided by the screen reader to create a
        “mental model” of the website (Lawson, 2019). This is where semantic
        markup comes in, in terms of letting the users know which elements are
        in the header or nav section (Lawson, 2019). This helps the user
        orientate themselves which will create a positive user experience
      </p>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        The Candle Merchant is not accessible using the screen reader. This is
        because the information is read based on hierarchy, not on sections. The
        user is unable to determine where they are on the site and therefore
        cannot use it properly. An example of this is that the larger text on
        the main image of the homepage is read before the options in the header.
        Another example is when the screen reader reaches the item section with
        images. The images have no description and are read as “one”, “two” and
        so on, until it reaches the end. Only after this are the prices of the
        items read. The cognitive load would be too much for a user with a
        disability since they cannot be expected to remember the item number and
        its corresponding price.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Users with disabilities require assistive technology, however, it is
        expensive, thus users require more viable options such as screen readers
        (Allen & Kleinman & Lazar & Malarkey 2007:). This is why it is important
        for developers to take this into consideration when designing a website.
        Accessibility is also related to the flexibility of a website. The
        flexibility of a website speaks to its responsive design.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Users access websites through different devices and the design needs to
        be responsive for it to be accessible. This is a user interface design
        principle (Uxpin 2020: 5). The Candle Merchant has a responsive design
        to a certain degree. The nav bar and the header are replaced with a
        burger button that displays the corresponding options when clicked. An
        example of poor responsive design is that the search bar on the homepage
        disappears when the screen is smaller. The homepage has one search bar.
        This is not consistent since all the other pages on the Candle Merchant
        have two search bars (one is in the header, and the other is on the left
        side of the screen). The search bar on any page other than the homepage
        goes to the bottom of the page for a smaller screen. This strays from
        convention and there is no clarity. This means that a user has no
        indication of how to proceed since they are unable to find the search
        bar. This is also an example of poor interface design since Clarity is a
        design principle (Uxpin 2020: 2). Another example of poor responsive
        design on the Candle Merchant is that text overlaps and cuts off on the
        homepage. The size of the text changes slightly but not enough to be
        readable for the user.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Clarity and consistency are vital aspects that determine the usability
        of a website (Cappel & Huang 2007: 117). The Candle Merchant uses the
        web design convention of indicating the active page by highlighting the
        title in the header (Cappel & Huang 2007: 117). However, this is
        inconsistent since it does not update when the user opens a particular
        page (Gift Ideas) through a button on the homepage. Another interface
        option is the call to action (CTA) at the bottom of every page that
        urges the user to sign up (Goldberg 2023). This assists the user with
        what steps to follow now that they have reached the bottom of a page.
      </p>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Visual structure is an important design principle since it relates to
        consistent design (Uxpin 2020: 5). This makes the user familiar with how
        to proceed throughout their time on a site. There is a discrepancy in
        navigation on the Candle Merchant. There is a navigation bar at the top
        of the screen and on the left side of the screen. This side navigation
        bar is not on the homepage. There is also an issue with the lack of
        visual hierarchy on the Candle Merchant. This can be seen by the same
        font, size and weight of text that is used for the name of the item, the
        descriptions as well as disclaimers. This is poor design because the
        user&apos;s attention is not being directed anywhere in particular. This
        also increases the cognitive load on a user since they require more
        effort to find information (Goldberg 2023).
      </p>
      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        All items that are interactable give feedback to a user when they hover
        their mouse over it except for one section of the homepage on the Candle
        Merchant. This section has buttons that are in the middle of the
        homepage and have a different design than every other button. These
        buttons have icons and a shadow they do not give the user any feedback
        when they hover over it. These buttons act as navigation options and are
        confusing to a user since the options on the header have the same
        function. Hick&apos;s law states that more options given to a user at a
        time increase the number of decisions that a user makes (Goldberg 2023).
        The user is not provided with a clear next step since they are presented
        with many options at any given point. Providing the user with a clear
        next step is a design principle and not following it negatively affects
        the interface (Uxpin 2020: 5).
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        The design principles create the usability of interfaces on a website.
        This gives designers the ability to direct attention and cause users to
        take certain actions. This is where ethical concerns of design come in
        (Goldberg 2023). An ethical issue for the Candle Merchant is
        prioritising their goals over the needs of a user. This can be seen in
        the “Gift Ideas” pages. There are two dark UX patterns at play since the
        text above an image presents a deal to a user (“Gift ideas under R150”).
        However, when the user clicks on the item the prices are displayed
        incorrectly. The Candle Merchant “shows” the equation to the user
        stating that these two items in this package equal X amount of money.
        This however does not add up since there is a hidden cost that is added,
        and the user is unaware of this (Battles & Gray & Hoggatt & Kou & Toombs
        2018: 2). This is manipulative since the site seemingly discloses that
        only the sum of the two items results in the total price, but this is
        not true due to the hidden cost.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        Another dark UX pattern is that items have a price range rather than a
        fixed value. This is a dark UX pattern because product attributes affect
        user interaction (Foxx & Funches & Kim & Park 2012: 1584). Users have
        primary concerns that help them achieve their goals (Foxx & Funches &
        Kim & Park 2012: 1584). A very common concern is price saving. Users
        become bargain hunters and look for the best deals.
      </p>

      <p class="paraspacing" class="e-content">
        The Candle Merchant overwhelms the user with many navigation options
        that have the same function throughout the site. They also make use of
        dark UX patterns that persuade the actions of a user in a way that
        benefits the Candle Merchant. It is evident that the design of this
        website was carefully constructed with usability in mind
