                My experience setting up Gitub. Reflection on the readings(Bush
                1979 -
                <i> As we may think</i> )(Borges 1998 -
                <i> The library of Babel</i> ). My Goals for this course.

                I am familiar with GitHub and already had it set up. I had a
                chance to use it last year for group assignments. It was
                overwhelming at first, but eventually, I understood its
                different features in saving and collaborating on work.

                <i><b> Bush ~As we may think-</b></i> In this reading, Bush
                discussed many possible advancements that could occur in the
                future. He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he
                knew what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to
                the fact that he was overwhelmed with the information presented
                to him (Bush, 1979). We are in the same predicament. We have
                lots of information coming our way from different sources and we
                are responsible for what we choose to interact with. I have
                always thought of the internet through the eyes of a user. Bush
                suggests that a mathematician is a skilled individual who has
                intuitive judgment(Bush, 1979). This is also coinciding with
                connotations of a creator. As a user, I am responsible for my

              <p>
                My goal for this course is to be able to understand different
                coding languages and to use them to create websites and apps. I
                want to further understand what goes into making a successful
                website.
