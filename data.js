He was accurate in his predictions; this was because he knew what he needed but not how it would be done. He alluded to the fact that he was overwhelmed with the information presented to him (Bush, 1979). We are in the same predicament. We have lots of information coming our way from different sources and we are responsible for what we choose to interact with. I have always thought of the internet through the eyes of a user. Bush suggests that a mathematician is a skilled individual who has intuitive judgment(Bush, 1979). This is also coinciding with connotations of a creator. As a user, I am responsible for my interactions on the internet, but as a creator, I need to carefully consider what information I put out. Bush speaks about dry photography concerning books. He mentions people being able to add notes to books and their comments. He also discusses the possibility of being able to have multiple “projection positions” so that we may view different sources of information(Bush, 1979). This helps us create our understanding and helps us connect different sources by switching between them. This was exactly what I was doing when interacting with this reading. I had multiple tabs open and clicked through them to draw my connections. It was also helpful to be able to add annotations to the readings when I had to google a term or add my thoughts. ",

This however does cause problems because it only changes how it looks visually, dev tools show that the text level may differ. This suggests that articles are a better way to contain headings and other data. Articles are also useful in sectioning data because the hierarchy for headers follows &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; . Sections are better suited to contain the beginning and end of a portion of an article. We need to learn about the accessibility of our websites to reach a wider range of users. Screen readers are useful tools and impact how some users will interact with our websites. This is why it is advantageous for us to learn how HTML elements impact screen readers. Screen readers are unable to tell one item on a reading list from another. Screen readers also don't indicate where one bit of information ends. An example of why this is a problem is that someone may want to use a screen reader to access information in the abstract before they decide if the website has the information that they require.

    t3para1: "The reading on convention and context is in accordance with the technical lecture on CSS. Before we start making huge design decisions, we need to get a sense of which UI and UX are successful and have thus become a convention. Conventions in terms of the Mailloux reading are practices that are created through a collaborative effort (Mailloux 2015: 399). This means that ideas that fall into certain conventions are agreed upon and act as a basis. Mailloux discusses three types of conventions. These are traditional conventions, prescriptive conventions, and constitutive conventions. Traditional conventions are common methods that have been used in the past (Mailloux 2015: 399). Conventions can change and quickly become the norm if it is adopted by others. This change in conventions makes room for innovative ideas (Mailloux 2015: 399). Conventions regarding UI and UX are vital for us to move forward as creators. By understanding the conventions of UI and UX we will be able to tackle the issues that arise because conventions have “regularities and expectations “(Mailloux 2015: 400). This means problems become solvable. There must be a reason why a practice becomes a convention. This is why we should learn from them. We need to break down traditional conventions and understand how and why they work (Mailloux 2015: 401). By understanding past methods, we can draw up new ideas for prescriptive conventions. Mailloux also discusses the idea that conventions are trans-situational (Mailloux 2015: 403). This is important to note that conventions are useful learning tools but are to be taken with a grain of salt. He suggests that sometimes conventions are not fully planned out ideas but rather solutions to fit the problem.",

An example of why this is useful is that we are making a portfolio website. Which means that we cannot use the conventions of an online store. We also need to clearly show how the user can interact with the website (Uxpin 2020:2). This is vital so that we avoid a “what now?” situation where the user is unsure how to proceed and then click off our website. Consistency is what creates a seamless interaction with a website (Uxpin 2020:3).

The term User experience (UX) has different connotation's that we can associate with names, the affective response and the usable functionality of technology. This reading outlined the importance of the emotional experience of the user and how this influences their decision-making (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006: 93). First responses stick and the designer needs to be able to grab the user's attention very quickly. As humans, we tend to remember negative interactions as opposed to positive ones. Thus, we must design a positive experience for the user. Designers can't directly conjure up a positive emotional response from a user since other aspects are involved. These other aspects are the environment in which the interaction takes place and the internal state of the user (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006: 95). The designed system affects UX, however, the other aspects need to be taken into consideration when designing. As designers, we are not able to control the user (well not entirely), but we can create our systems with a positive context in mind (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006: 94). This is where the Experiential approach comes in. This approach suggests that the product and the internal state of the user need to complement each other, and this will result in UX. It is important to consider what goes into creating products for the user. We need to carefully consider what we include in our design because every little detail adds to an experience. This reading made me realise that there needs to be reasoning behind what we create because this ultimately will affect how a product is interacted with.",

It looks at issues surrounding computational fields that negatively affect black women. This reading identifies that there are fundamental problems in our society, and this can be seen through the hierarchy of race and gender (Birhane & Guest 2020: 3). This oppressive system thrives on conformity and seeks to outcast those who rebel (Birhane & Guest 2020: 1). POC are conditioned to comply with this system through years of “training” (Birhane & Guest 2020: 1). This is enforced by beneficiaries of this system and can be seen by the discrediting of experiences of POC (Birhane & Guest 2020: 2). This can also be seen by the difficulties facing POC that wish to access and be a part of the computational fields (Birhane & Guest 2020: 2). ",
    t3para2: "Black women face many challenges accessing and contributing to academia (Birhane & Guest 2020: 2). An example of this is the purposeful lack of exclusion of black women’s writing. Another issue is the simple retraction of papers that contain white supremacist foundations (Birhane & Guest 2020: 3). A retraction of a paper does not undo the harm that it has done and the work that it has inspired, thus more thorough methods of exclusions should be explored. A suggestion from the reading on how to present this is to re-examine and reimagine academic work.  A few changes here and there are not going to keep the peace or quiet the oppressed, thus a more conscious effort should be made.",

    t2para1: "<b>How CSS Relates to HTML and JS-</b>I enjoyed learning more about CSS this week. In the first few weeks, we learnt HTML separately and then we added CSS. It was interesting to see how JS expands the capabilities of CSS. The functions we create in JS take the user's interaction a step further and allow them to customise the site. An example of this is the dark mode function. Many apps have implemented this, and this grows their user base. Since it fulfils the user's goal of easily viewing information.",

    t2para3: "The challenge that I have faced with responsive design is deciding how to implement it. This is challenging because I want my website to maintain a consistent design. This was an issue in my first assignment in terms of my different button designs. This means that I had to use different methods to make my buttons responsive. I also found that I needed to be more flexible with the values that I used when making aspects responsive. An example of this is that my header was widely spaced, and I was looking at it in Chrome but when I opened it in Edge, the sidebars of the browser made the screen smaller. This just so happened to be the perfect size to “break” the headers of my website since it pushed text oddly around the screen.",

This lecture put in perspective how big of an issue this is and why we need to be asking those questions. We as users and creators should not separate ourselves from this issue because it affects our environment and the people in it. By not questioning this we allow systems of power and patterns to be repeated. Thus, there is no urgency for change. Which means groups of marginalised people are not catered for. ",

I have only been learning to adhere to the guidelines of the code and haven’t been questioning them.

After this revelation, I had a few questions. Do we fix the old ways, or do we create new ones? I think that both are needed. We can salvage the good of the past and discard the rest. The discarded bits, however, need to be dissected and understood. This is the only way for this new system to work since we can learn from past mistakes and do better.",

    t3para1: "The reading by Costanza Chock on travelling while trans, highlighted many issues faced by marginalised groups. This reading also gave suggestions on how to combat these issues. The Design Justice Network proposed that through collaboration gaps in design can be filled (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6). The role of a designer needs to change because their “good intentions are not enough”(Costanza-Chock 2020: 5). Designers do not necessarily create products with the intention of disadvantaging people or discriminating against them. However, their designs still do this. This is because gaining baseline knowledge is insufficient since this baseline knowledge does not encapsulate the lived experiences of individuals. This lived experience is what leads individuals to be an expert and they need to be consulted in the design process (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6). This collaboration should be ongoing because a once-off consultation will not fix all the issues that marginalised people face. This collaboration is vital in changing systems (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6). Since adding insight from someone that has been affected can in turn better the system by understanding their experience (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6).",
    t3para2: "It has been said that systems are “broken”.  Since they fail to cater for every group. Even though it has been said these systems remain in place and in some cases unchanged. The idea that these systems “work” since it caters for the majority is why it remains. This however is inaccurate and discredits the need for change. An example of this is that five people may speak up and this is seen as the system only failing five people. These five people represent a larger group that is affected by the system (Costanza-Chock 2020: 14). Not everyone will speak up. Marginalised groups are brought up in a system that rewards conformity, thus they are less likely to report on problems they face. (This was also spoken about in my blog for Week 9 on the reading by Sheena Magenya.) This is why systems need to be created with a wider demographic in mind.",

These issues mainly affected lower-income households (Glynos & Tataki, 2020). This is because the unemployment rate increased for people who lacked a degree and people who lacked access to the Internet. People who fall into this category were part of the service industry and their jobs consisted of physical labour which could not be achieved online (Glynos & Tataki, 2020). Many students were disadvantaged since they could not access e-learning content. Governments saw the negative effects that occurred when people could not access the internet. A few strategies were put in place to alleviate many of these issues. However, those solutions were temporary, and a long-term plan needs to be put in place so that people can access the Internet.",

    t5para2: "<b>Predictive algorithms in Justice system and limits of techno reformisms </b> AI and algorithms play important roles in society due to the digital age. AI is used to inform the decisions made by people in power. This becomes problematic when AI fabricates information used in Justice systems. It uses predictive algorithms that “inflate” the risks of marginalised groups particularly black people (Ugwudike, 2022). This perpetuates bias (Ugwudike, 2022). An example of this is the AI used in justice systems increases the rates of recidivism for black inmates. This alters a person’s life and influences their sentences and parole options. ",
    t5para3: "At times when the “fairness “of these algorithms were brought into question creators chimed in stating that based on the data used the result are fair (Ugwudike, 2022). This means that even if the data shows signs of discrimination the results are fair since the system is fulfilling its purpose. This is whether the issue of value lock-in comes in. Despite knowing that there are gaps in data companies still use this data to train AI models. The creators of these algorithms choose what data to include or exclude which brings into question who’s values are being remade.  This is why it is important for me as a designer to be aware of how my actions affect people and to always take this into consideration. It is not enough for me to identify the issues with my designs, I need to be proactive and change those designs for the better.",
